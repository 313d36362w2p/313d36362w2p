Just a place to store code and provide an inter-connect of my thoughts through digital profiles.

You can find related stuff about my activities all over the place. I am involved in reverse engineering, cryptography, malware/exploit development, hardware, photography, gardening, cooking, natural sciences, ethics philosophy, history preservation/archivist, sex education/positivity, social responsibility, vitƒÅria, and pop culture spaces; among other things. 

Despite being a bit of a private person, I love collaborating; so, if you want to work on some interesting research or have some questions, feel free to reach out!
